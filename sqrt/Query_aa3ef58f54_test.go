Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-unit-sample using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Test when the `start` index is 0 and `end` index is less than the block size. This will cover the scenario where query is performed within a single block.

2. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are within the same block and `start` is not 0. This will cover the scenario where query is performed within a single block but not from the beginning.

3. Test when the `start` index is at the beginning of a block and `end` index is at the end of the same block. This will cover the scenario where query is performed for the entire block.

4. Test when the `start` index is at the beginning of a block and `end` index is in a different block. This will cover the scenario where query spans multiple blocks.

5. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are in different blocks and `start` is not at the beginning of a block. This will cover the scenario where query spans multiple blocks but not from the beginning of the first block.

6. Test when the `start` index is 0 and `end` index is at the end of the elements. This will test the scenario where query is performed for all elements.

7. Test when the `start` index is greater than `end` index. This will cover the scenario where invalid indices are provided.

8. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are at the same position. This will cover the scenario where query is performed for a single element.

9. Test when the `start` index is less than 0 or `end` index is greater than the size of the elements. This will cover the scenario where out of range indices are provided.

10. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are both 0. This will test the scenario where query is performed for the first element.

11. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are both at the end of the elements. This will test the scenario where query is performed for the last element.

12. Test when the `start` index and `end` index are in the middle of the elements array. This will cover the scenario where query is performed for elements in the middle of the array.

13. Test when the block size is 0. This will cover the scenario where block size is not properly initialized.

14. Test when the block size is greater than the size of the elements. This will cover the scenario where block size is larger than total elements.
