Scenario 1: Testing Positive Sequence with varying lengths

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify the function's ability to handle a sequence of values composed of both negative and positive integers for different length of the array input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input arrays with an array of positive as well as negative numbers.
    Act: Call the MaxSubarraySum function with the arrays.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the right maximum subarray sum.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to validate that the function processes the array correctly and returns the correct maximum subarray sum. The logic behind the expected result is that the output should be the sum of the largest subarray in the input array. This test is important to prove that the function is working correctly with different lengths of array inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing All Negative Numbers

  Details:
    Description: These tests are to verify how the function handles arrays consisting of all negative numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepared arrays with all elements as negative integers.
    Act: Call the MaxSubarraySum function with the arrays.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the right maximum subarray sum.
  Validation:
    As these tests involve negative numbers, the expected result is to return the least negative number as the largest sum subarray would be that number itself. This set of tests validates how well the function handles edge cases where all elements are negative.

Scenario 3: Testing Empty Array

  Details:
    Description: These tests are for checking how the function handles an empty array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepared an empty array.
    Act: Call the MaxSubarraySum function with the array.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns zero as the maximum subarray sum.
  Validation:
    When an empty array is passed to the function, it should ideally return '0', as there's no element inside the array. This test validates that our function correctly handles an empty array.

Scenario 4: Testing Single Element Array

  Details:
    Description: These tests are meant to validate how the function handles a single element in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepared arrays with only a single element for different values (positive, negative and zero).
    Act: Call the MaxSubarraySum function with the arrays.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct maximum subarray sum.
  Validation:
    For a single element in an array, the largest subarray sum should be the element value itself. This test takes care of probable edge cases with various single element values. This ensures robustness in handling exceptional cases.  

Scenario 5: Testing Array with Zeros

  Details:
    Description: This test handles arrays that include zero or multiple zeros among other numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare arrays with no other numbers, positive numbers and negative numbers but must include at least a zero.
    Act: Call the MaxSubarraySum function with the arrays.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns the correct maximum subarray sum.
  Validation:
    In cases that involve zeros, the function must be able to skip the zeros unless the zero is the largest subarray sum itself. If the array contains only zeros, the return should be zero. This test ensures that the function accurately determines when to consider or ignore zeros.
