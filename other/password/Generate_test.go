**Scenario 1: Test Generate with valid min and max length values**

Description: This test is to ensure that the Generate function can process and return a valid password string when given valid minLength and maxLength values. 

Execution:
  `Arrange:` Set maxLength to a number greater than minLength, set minLength to a valid value (say, 5).
  
  `Act:` Invoke Generate function with the minLength and maxLength values provided above.
  
  `Assert:` The returned password should confirm to the rules_bound within minLength and maxLength, and have a mix of alphanumeric 
  characters and symbols.

Validation: We assert that the length of the returned password is within the minLength and maxLength values. This is to make sure the function works properly under standard, ideal circumstances. This is a crucial check as it helps validate standard password generation functionality that the system might require for user creation.


**Scenario 2: Test Generate with equal min and max length values**

Description: This test checks the capability of Generate function when minLength and maxLength values are equal. 

Execution:
  `Arrange:` Set maxLength equal to minLength, both to a valid value (say, 10).
  
  `Act:` Invoke Generate function with the minLength and maxLength values provided above.
  
  `Assert:` The returned password should be of the length specified and have a mix of alphanumeric 
  characters and symbols.

Validation: Here, we assert that the length of the returned password is exactly the same as the input parameters. This is to ensure that in scenarios when the password length is required to be of a certain fixed size, the function can handle it appropriately.


**Scenario 3: Test Generate with minLength greater than maxLength value**
  
Description: This test aims to check and validate the Generate function's behaviour when supplied with invalid input values (when minLength is greater than maxLength). 

Execution:
  `Arrange:` Set maxLength to a number lesser than minLength.
  
  `Act:` Invoke Generate function with the minLength and maxLength values provided above.
  
  `Assert:` As this is an edge case scenario, it is expected to panic rather than returning a valid result. 

Validation: Here, we verify if the function can handle illogical or invalid input parameters, and should panic as expected. This edge case is necessary to handle invalid values and to ensure that the function does not fall into incoherent states.


**Scenario 4: Test Generate with max length value of 0**

Description: In this test scenario, the Generate function's behaviour when provided with maxLength of 0 is being checked which is an edge case scenario.

Execution:
  `Arrange:` Set maxLength to 0 and minLength to a valid value.
  
  `Act:` Invoke Generate function with the minLength and maxLength values provided above.
  
  `Assert:` Check for a panic situation as the maxLength is a inappropriate value. 

Validation: The point of this test is to ensure the function can handle and react appropriately under edge cases when maxLength is zero. This is necessary because a length of 0 isn't practical from a usage standpoint.
