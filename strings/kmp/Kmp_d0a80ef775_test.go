================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
Issue: The code does not perform adequate bounds checking when iterating over the `word` and `text` strings. This could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause other unintended behavior.
Solution: Implement proper bounds checking when accessing elements of the `word` and `text` strings. Use the `len()` function to ensure that the indices being accessed are within the valid range of the strings.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The code does not handle potential errors that may occur during the execution of the `Kmp` function, such as out-of-bounds errors or unexpected input. This could lead to undefined behavior or crashes, potentially exposing the system to further attacks.
Solution: Implement proper error handling by wrapping the critical sections of the code in `defer` and `recover` statements. Return appropriate error values from the `Kmp` function to allow the caller to handle exceptions gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code does not have any mechanisms to limit the size of the `matches` slice or the number of matches it can return. This could lead to excessive memory consumption and denial-of-service attacks if the `text` parameter contains a large number of occurrences of the `word` parameter.
Solution: Introduce a limit on the maximum number of matches to be returned, either by returning only the first `N` matches or by providing an option to the caller to specify the desired maximum number of matches. This will help prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Kmp search with a match

Details:
Description: This test scenario verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly identifies and returns the indices of all occurrences of the `word` string within the `text` string.

Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a `word` string, a `text` string containing the `word`, and a `patternTable` slice with the appropriate values.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the prepared inputs.
Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice of indices where the `word` was found within the `text`.

Validation:
The expected result is a slice of indices where the `word` was found within the `text`. This test validates the core functionality of the `Kmp` function, ensuring that it correctly identifies and returns the expected matches. It is an essential test to ensure the proper operation of the algorithm.

Scenario 2: Kmp search with no match

Details:
Description: This test scenario verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles the case where the `word` string is not found within the `text` string.

Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a `word` string and a `text` string that do not contain any occurrences of the `word`.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the prepared inputs.
Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice, indicating that no matches were found.

Validation:
The expected result is an empty slice, as the `word` string is not present in the `text` string. This test ensures that the `Kmp` function correctly handles the case where no matches are found, which is an important aspect of the function's behavior.

Scenario 3: Kmp search with an empty word or text

Details:
Description: This test scenario verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles the case where the `word` or `text` string is empty.

Execution:
Arrange: Prepare an empty `word` string and a non-empty `text` string, as well as an empty `text` string and a non-empty `word` string.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the prepared inputs.
Assert: Verify that the function returns `nil` in both cases, indicating that the search cannot be performed.

Validation:
The expected result is `nil` when either the `word` or `text` string is empty, as the search cannot be performed in these cases. This test ensures that the `Kmp` function correctly handles these edge cases, which is important for the function's robustness and error handling.

Scenario 4: Kmp search with a word longer than the text

Details:
Description: This test scenario verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles the case where the `word` string is longer than the `text` string.

Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a `word` string that is longer than the `text` string, and a non-empty `patternTable` slice.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the prepared inputs.
Assert: Verify that the function returns `nil`, indicating that the search cannot be performed.

Validation:
The expected result is `nil` when the `word` string is longer than the `text` string, as the search cannot be performed in this case. This test ensures that the `Kmp` function correctly handles this edge case, which is important for the function's error handling and input validation.

Scenario 5: Kmp search with a malformed pattern table

Details:
Description: This test scenario verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles the case where the `patternTable` slice is not properly constructed.

Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a `word` string, a `text` string, and a `patternTable` slice with invalid or unexpected values.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the prepared inputs.
Assert: Verify that the function returns the expected result, which may be `nil` or a slice of indices, depending on the specific implementation of the function.

Validation:
The expected result in this scenario may vary depending on the implementation of the `Kmp` function and how it handles a malformed `patternTable`. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case, either by returning `nil` or by producing the expected results based on the provided `patternTable`. This is important for ensuring the robustness and reliability of the `Kmp` function.
