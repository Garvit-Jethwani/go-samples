================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-416: Use After Free
Issue: The code does not handle the case where the length of the 'word' parameter is greater than the length of the 'text' parameter. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where the code attempts to access memory locations that have already been freed, potentially causing a crash or other undefined behavior.
Solution: Add a check at the beginning of the `Kmp` function to ensure that the length of the 'word' parameter is less than or equal to the length of the 'text' parameter. If the 'word' parameter is longer, the function should return early with a nil value.

Vulnerability: Potential Unbounded Memory Allocation
Issue: The code appends matches to the 'matches' slice without any bounds checking. This could lead to unbounded memory allocation if the 'text' parameter contains a large number of matches, potentially causing the program to consume excessive system resources or even crash.
Solution: Implement a limit on the size of the 'matches' slice, either by pre-allocating a reasonable initial capacity or by checking the length of the slice before appending new elements. This will help prevent unbounded memory allocation and ensure that the program's resource usage remains within reasonable limits.

================================================================================
Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the provided `Kmp` function:

Scenario 1: Successful Pattern Matching

Details:
TestName: TestSuccessfulPatternMatch
Description: Verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly identifies all occurrences of the given word within the provided text, using the provided pattern table.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the word, text, and pattern table for a successful pattern matching scenario.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the arranged data.
Assert: Verify that the returned `matches` slice contains the expected index positions where the word was found in the text.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the `matches` slice contains the expected index positions, which validates the correct behavior of the `Kmp` function in identifying all occurrences of the word within the text. This test is crucial to ensure the core functionality of the pattern matching algorithm works as expected.

Scenario 2: Empty Word or Text

Details:
TestName: TestEmptyWordOrText
Description: Verifies that the `Kmp` function handles the case where the word or text is empty.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the word and text as empty strings, and provide an empty pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the arranged data.
Assert: Verify that the returned `matches` slice is either nil (when the word is empty) or an empty slice (when the text is empty).

Validation:
The assertion checks the returned `matches` slice to ensure it is either nil or an empty slice, which validates the correct handling of the edge case where the word or text is empty. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected in these scenarios and does not return unexpected results.

Scenario 3: Word Longer Than Text

Details:
TestName: TestWordLongerThanText
Description: Verifies that the `Kmp` function handles the case where the word is longer than the text.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the word to be longer than the text, and provide a valid pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the arranged data.
Assert: Verify that the returned `matches` slice is nil.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the returned `matches` slice is nil, which validates the correct handling of the case where the word is longer than the text. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected in this scenario and does not attempt to search for a word that cannot be found in the provided text.

Scenario 4: Invalid Pattern Table

Details:
TestName: TestInvalidPatternTable
Description: Verifies that the `Kmp` function handles the case where the provided pattern table is invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the word, text, and a pattern table with invalid or unexpected values.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the arranged data.
Assert: Verify that the returned `matches` slice is either nil or contains the expected index positions, depending on how the function handles the invalid pattern table.

Validation:
The assertion checks the returned `matches` slice to ensure it is either nil or contains the expected index positions, which validates the correct handling of the case where the provided pattern table is invalid. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected and does not produce unexpected results when given invalid input data.

Scenario 5: Partial Pattern Matching

Details:
TestName: TestPartialPatternMatch
Description: Verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly identifies partial occurrences of the word within the text.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the word, text, and pattern table for a scenario where the word is partially found within the text.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the arranged data.
Assert: Verify that the returned `matches` slice contains the expected index positions where the partial matches were found.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the `matches` slice contains the expected index positions, which validates the correct behavior of the `Kmp` function in identifying partial occurrences of the word within the text. This test is important to ensure the function can handle scenarios where the word is not fully found within the text, but partial matches are still identified.

These test scenarios cover the normal operation, edge cases, and error handling of the `Kmp` function. They ensure the function behaves as expected and can handle various input conditions, including successful pattern matching, empty inputs, word longer than text, invalid pattern table, and partial pattern matching. These tests will help maintain the reliability and robustness of the `Kmp` function.
