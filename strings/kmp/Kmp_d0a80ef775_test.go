================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
Issue: The code is susceptible to a race condition vulnerability due to the use of the `i+j < len(text)` condition in the `for` loop. This can lead to out-of-bounds access if the length of `text` changes between the check and the subsequent access, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service or other security issues.
Solution: Refactor the code to use a single variable to track the current position in `text`, and perform the length check only once before the loop. This ensures that the loop will not access beyond the bounds of `text`, mitigating the race condition vulnerability.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code appends matches to the `matches` slice without any bounds checking. This can lead to unbounded memory consumption if the `text` contains a large number of matches, potentially causing a denial-of-service attack by exhausting the system's resources.
Solution: Implement a cap on the size of the `matches` slice to prevent it from growing beyond a reasonable limit. You can use the `make([]int, 0, estimatedSize)` function to pre-allocate the slice with an initial capacity, and then use the built-in `append()` function to add new matches, checking if the slice has reached its capacity before expanding it further.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not handle the case where `word` is longer than `text`. In this scenario, the function will return `nil`, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the caller expects a non-nil slice of matches.
Solution: Modify the function to return an empty slice instead of `nil` when `word` is longer than `text`. This will ensure that the caller can handle the case of no matches without encountering a null pointer dereference.

================================================================================
Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the provided `Kmp` function:

Scenario 1: Test the function with a word that is longer than the text

Details:
TestName: TestKmpWithWordLongerThanText
Description: This test verifies that the `Kmp` function returns `nil` when the word is longer than the text.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a word that is longer than the text and a pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the word, text, and pattern table.
Assert: Verify that the function returns `nil`.

Validation:
The test asserts that the function returns `nil` when the word is longer than the text, which is the expected behavior. This is important to ensure that the function handles cases where the input parameters are not valid.

Scenario 2: Test the function with a word that is exactly the same as the text

Details:
TestName: TestKmpWithWordEqualToText
Description: This test verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly identifies all occurrences of the word in the text when they are exactly the same.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a word that is exactly the same as the text and a pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the word, text, and pattern table.
Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice containing a single index, which is 0.

Validation:
The test asserts that the function returns a slice containing a single index, which is 0, when the word is exactly the same as the text. This is the expected behavior, as the word should be found at the beginning of the text.

Scenario 3: Test the function with a word that is a substring of the text

Details:
TestName: TestKmpWithWordAsSubstring
Description: This test verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly identifies all occurrences of the word in the text when the word is a substring of the text.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a word that is a substring of the text and a pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the word, text, and pattern table.
Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice containing all the indices where the word is found in the text.

Validation:
The test asserts that the function returns a slice containing all the indices where the word is found in the text. This is the expected behavior, as the function should be able to identify all occurrences of the word in the text.

Scenario 4: Test the function with an empty word and text

Details:
TestName: TestKmpWithEmptyWordAndText
Description: This test verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles cases where the word and the text are both empty.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty word and an empty text, and a pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the word, text, and pattern table.
Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.

Validation:
The test asserts that the function returns an empty slice when both the word and the text are empty. This is the expected behavior, as there are no occurrences of the word in the text.

Scenario 5: Test the function with a word that is not present in the text

Details:
TestName: TestKmpWithWordNotInText
Description: This test verifies that the `Kmp` function correctly handles cases where the word is not present in the text.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a word that is not present in the text and a pattern table.
Act: Invoke the `Kmp` function with the word, text, and pattern table.
Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.

Validation:
The test asserts that the function returns an empty slice when the word is not present in the text. This is the expected behavior, as there are no occurrences of the word in the text.

These test scenarios cover normal operation, edge cases, and error handling for the `Kmp` function. They ensure that the function behaves as expected under different input conditions and that it correctly identifies all occurrences of the word in the text.
