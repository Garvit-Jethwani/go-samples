================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input parameters word and text. Malicious input could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure word and text are non-empty strings and patternTable is a valid slice of integers.

Vulnerability: CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
Issue: If patternTable contains out-of-bounds indices, accessing patternTable[j] may lead to an out-of-bounds read, causing a runtime panic.
Solution: Validate the values in patternTable to ensure they are within valid bounds before using them to index into the slice.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The arithmetic operations i+j and i+j-patternTable[j] may result in integer overflow if the values are sufficiently large.
Solution: Perform bounds checking on i, j, and patternTable[j] to prevent integer overflow. Use Go's math package for safe arithmetic operations if needed.

================================================================================
Here are some test scenarios for the provided Kmp function in Go:

Scenario 1: Exact Match

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly identifies an exact match of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable parameters with an exact match scenario.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains the expected starting index of the exact match.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the matches slice contains the correct starting index.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function can find an exact match of the word in the text.

Scenario 2: No Match

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Kmp function returns an empty slice when there is no match of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable parameters with a scenario where the word does not exist in the text.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the matches slice has a length of 0.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the word is not found in the text.

Scenario 3: Multiple Matches

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly identifies multiple occurrences of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable parameters with a scenario where the word appears multiple times in the text.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains all the expected starting indices of the matches.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the matches slice contains the correct starting indices of all the matches.
  This test ensures that the Kmp function can find multiple occurrences of the word in the text.

Scenario 4: Word Longer Than Text

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Kmp function returns nil when the word is longer than the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable parameters with a scenario where the word is longer than the text.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice is nil.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the matches slice is nil.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the word is longer than the text.

Scenario 5: Empty Word

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Kmp function when the word is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word as an empty string, and provide appropriate text and patternTable parameters.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify the expected behavior, such as returning nil or an empty matches slice.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice matches the expected behavior for an empty word.
  This test ensures that the Kmp function handles the case of an empty word correctly.

Scenario 6: Empty Text

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the Kmp function when the text is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the text as an empty string, and provide appropriate word and patternTable parameters.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify the expected behavior, such as returning nil or an empty matches slice.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice matches the expected behavior for an empty text.
  This test ensures that the Kmp function handles the case of an empty text correctly.

Scenario 7: Overlapping Matches

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly handles overlapping matches of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable parameters with a scenario where the word overlaps with itself in the text.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains the expected starting indices of the overlapping matches.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the matches slice contains the correct starting indices of the overlapping matches.
  This test ensures that the Kmp function can handle overlapping occurrences of the word in the text.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the Kmp function, including exact matches, no matches, multiple matches, edge cases like empty word and empty text, and overlapping matches. They help validate the correctness and robustness of the Kmp function implementation.
