================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input parameters word and text. Malicious input could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure word and text are non-empty strings and patternTable is a valid slice of integers.

Vulnerability: CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
Issue: If patternTable contains out-of-bounds indices, accessing patternTable[j] may read memory outside the slice bounds, leading to a program crash or information disclosure.
Solution: Validate that all values in patternTable are within valid bounds before using them to index the slice.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The arithmetic operations i+j and i+j-patternTable[j] may overflow if the values are sufficiently large, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Use safe arithmetic operations or check for overflow conditions before performing the calculations.

================================================================================
Here are some test scenarios for the provided Kmp function in Go:

Scenario 1: Exact Match

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly finds an exact match of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable with an exact match scenario.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains the correct starting index of the match.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is not nil and contains the expected starting index.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function can find an exact match of the word in the text.

Scenario 2: No Match

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly handles a scenario where the word is not found in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable with a no match scenario.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is empty (has a length of 0).
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the word is not present in the text.

Scenario 3: Multiple Matches

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly finds multiple occurrences of the word in the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable with a scenario containing multiple matches.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains all the correct starting indices of the matches.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is not nil and contains all the expected starting indices.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function can find multiple occurrences of the word in the text.

Scenario 4: Word Longer Than Text

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly handles a scenario where the word is longer than the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text, and patternTable with a scenario where the word is longer than the text.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice is nil.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is nil.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the word is longer than the text and returns nil.

Scenario 5: Empty Word

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly handles a scenario where the word is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word as an empty string, text, and patternTable.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice contains all the indices of the text.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is not nil and contains all the indices of the text.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the word is empty and returns all the indices of the text.

Scenario 6: Empty Text

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Kmp function correctly handles a scenario where the text is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the word, text as an empty string, and patternTable.
  Act: Invoke the Kmp function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned matches slice is nil.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned matches slice is nil.
  This test is important to ensure that the Kmp function correctly handles cases where the text is empty and returns nil.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the Kmp function, including exact match, no match, multiple matches, word longer than text, empty word, and empty text scenarios. They ensure that the function behaves correctly under different conditions and handles edge cases appropriately.
