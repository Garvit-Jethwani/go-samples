Scenario 1: Test with a Palindrome String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a palindrome string. A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to set up any data or mocks for this test, we just need a test string that is a palindrome, like "radar".
  Act: Invoke the IsPalindrome function with the test string "radar".
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is that the function returns true when given a palindrome string. This is based on the definition of a palindrome. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies palindrome strings.

Scenario 2: Test with a Non-Palindrome String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a non-palindrome string.
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to set up any data or mocks for this test, we just need a test string that is not a palindrome, like "hello".
  Act: Invoke the IsPalindrome function with the test string "hello".
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion is that the function returns false when given a non-palindrome string. This is based on the definition of a palindrome. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies non-palindrome strings.

Scenario 3: Test with an Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function handles an empty string correctly. According to the definition of a palindrome, an empty string can be considered a palindrome since it reads the same forwards and backwards.
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to set up any data or mocks for this test, we just need an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsPalindrome function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is that the function returns true when given an empty string. This is based on the definition of a palindrome. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases like an empty string.

Scenario 4: Test with a String Containing Spaces and Punctuation

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a string containing spaces and punctuation. According to the definition of a palindrome, a string that reads the same backwards as forwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, is considered a palindrome.
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to set up any data or mocks for this test, we just need a test string that is a palindrome when ignoring spaces and punctuation, like "Able , was I saw elba".
  Act: Invoke the IsPalindrome function with the test string "Able , was I saw elba".
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is that the function returns true when given a string that is a palindrome when ignoring spaces and punctuation. This is based on the definition of a palindrome. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles strings containing spaces and punctuation.
