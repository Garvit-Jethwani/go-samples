Test generated by RoostGPT for test golang-sample-programs using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Test with a valid palindrome string: The function should return true when input is a valid palindrome. For example, the string "racecar" is a palindrome.

2. Test with a non-palindrome string: The function should return false when the input string is not a palindrome. For example, the string "hello" is not a palindrome.

3. Test with a palindrome string that contains spaces: The function should return true when the input string is a palindrome, even if it contains spaces. For example, the string "A man a plan a canal Panama" is a palindrome.

4. Test with a palindrome string that contains punctuation: The function should return true when the input string is a palindrome, even if it contains punctuation. For example, the string "Able , was I saw elba." is a palindrome.

5. Test with a palindrome string that contains mixed case: The function should return true when the input string is a palindrome, even if it contains both upper and lower case letters. For example, the string "Able was I saw Elba" is a palindrome.

6. Test with an empty string: The function should return true when the input string is empty. An empty string is considered to be a palindrome.

7. Test with a single character string: The function should return true when the input string has a single character. A single character string is considered to be a palindrome.

8. Test with a string that contains special characters: The function should return true or false based on whether the string, after removing special characters, is a palindrome or not. For example, the string "@#$$#@" is a palindrome but "@#$$$#@" is not.

9. Test with a string that contains numbers: The function should return true or false based on whether the string, after removing special characters, is a palindrome or not. For example, the string "12321" is a palindrome but "12345" is not.

10. Test with a palindrome string that contains non-alphanumeric characters: The function should return true when the input string is a palindrome, even if it contains non-alphanumeric characters. For example, the string "!@#$%^&*()_+)(*&^%$#@!" is a palindrome.
