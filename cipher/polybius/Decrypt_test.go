ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_2aa67b3256

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
Issue: The slice operation in decipher might exceed the string bounds leading to runtime panic.
Solution: Validate slice indices before use and ensure they do not exceed the string's length.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: Lack of detailed error handling after deciphering which could obscure the source of errors in complex systems.
Solution: Implement more granular error handling to provide clearer insights into failures within the decipher method.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Valid Decryption

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly decrypt a given encrypted text using the provided key and character set. The test ensures that the decryption process correctly interprets and converts each pair of characters back into their original form.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `Polybius` struct with a predefined size, characters, and key. Provide a valid encrypted text that corresponds to the setup.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` method on the `Polybius` instance with the encrypted text.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected plaintext. Use `assert.Equal` to check equality between the expected and actual results.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Using `assert.Equal` ensures that the decryption process accurately transforms the encrypted text back to its original state.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Accurate decryption is critical for the application's functionality, especially in contexts where data integrity and correctness are paramount.

### Scenario 2: Empty Text Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the decryption function handles an empty string input gracefully. It should return an empty string without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `Polybius` struct with any valid configuration.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` method with an empty string.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is empty and no error is returned. Use `assert.NoError` for checking the absence of errors and `assert.Empty` for the result.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: `assert.NoError` and `assert.Empty` confirm that the function can handle edge cases without failing.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring that edge cases like empty inputs do not lead to unexpected behavior is crucial for robustness.

### Scenario 3: Odd Number of Characters in Input

Details:
  Description: Tests the function's response to an input string with an odd number of characters, which might not align with the expected two-character decryption blocks.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `Polybius` instance and provide a string with an odd number of characters.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` method.
  Assert: Check for an error to ensure the function handles this case properly, potentially warning the user or adjusting processing logic.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Using `assert.Error` checks that the function does not silently fail or incorrectly process malformed inputs.
  Discuss the importance of the test: It's important for the function to provide clear feedback or handle incorrect inputs gracefully, ensuring reliable operation.

### Scenario 4: Invalid Characters in Input

Details:
  Description: Ensures that the decryption function can handle or report errors when the input text contains characters not found in the `characters` string of the `Polybius` struct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `Polybius` instance with a specific character set and provide text including characters outside this set.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` method.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned, indicating the presence of invalid characters.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: `assert.Error` ensures that the function alerts to issues with input data, maintaining data integrity.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Preventing the decryption of texts with invalid characters avoids misinterpretations and potential security issues.

### Scenario 5: Decryption Function Error Handling

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `Decrypt` function correctly handles and propagates errors from the `decipher` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `decipher` method to return an error. Set up a `Polybius` instance and provide valid input text.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` method.
  Assert: Expect an error to be returned, and verify that the error message includes "failed decipher".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: `assert.Error` and checking the error message validate that errors in lower-level operations are correctly handled and communicated.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Proper error handling and propagation are essential for debugging and maintaining the reliability of the cryptographic process.
