ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=encipher_01925533aa

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-114: Process Control
Issue: User input directly influences control flow in cryptographic operations, potentially leading to incorrect encryption/decryption if input mismatches expected characters.
Solution: Implement strict input validation and sanitation before processing it in encryption or decryption, maybe use a predefined set of allowed characters and validate against it.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The key used in the cryptographic operations is hardcoded into the application, making it easier for an attacker to decipher the encryption if the source code is exposed.
Solution: Dynamically generate encryption keys through a secure process and ensure they are stored securely, not in the source code.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Input validation is performed after processing has begun in the NewPolybius function, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior when provided with abnormal input sizes or characters.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are validated before any processing takes place to avoid triggering errors deep in the method stack.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive information may be printed or logged directly from function calls leading to information leaks, for example, detailed error messages exposing encryption keys or configuration.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information or use masked/error-handled logs that do not reveal details about the cryptographic settings or keys.

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the `encipher` function from the Polybius cipher implementation in Go, as extracted from the source code.

### Scenario 1: Valid Single Character Enciphering
**Details:**
  Description: This test checks the enciphering of a single valid character within the key and verifies the encrypted output.
  
**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create a typical Polybius cipher instance with predefined size, characters, and key. Make sure the character to encipher is covered in the key.
  Act: Call the encipher method with a valid single character.
  Assert: Use the Go `assert.Equal` to compare the expected output with the actual result.

**Validation:**
  Justify: Function should accurately map a single character as per the Polybius square rules using the predetermined grids.
  Importance: Ensures fundamental single character enciphering functions as expected, a base for more complex encryption.

### Scenario 2: Character Not in Key
**Details:**
  Description: This test verifies the function's response when an input character is not included in the Polybius key.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Provide a character that is not included in the initialized Polybius object's key.
  Act: Execute the encipher method with the non-included character.
  Assert: Use `assert.Error` to check for an error response.

**Validation:**
  Justify: Correctly handles and flags characters that are not mapped in the Polybius key, preventing undefined behavior.
  Importance: Proper error handling is essential for the stability and correct error reporting in the cipher module.

### Scenario 3: Key Boundary Check
**Details:**
  Description: Assesses whether characters on the boundary of the size specification correctly encrypt.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Initialize the Polybius structure using boundary characters as part of the size and key.
  Act: Encipher the boundary character.
  Assert: Assert equality of the returned character mappings.

**Validation:**
  Justify: Tests the functionâ€™s reliability with edge values and boundary conditions of the key.
  Importance: Ensures reliability and consistent behavior of the encryption system, particularly under edge cases.

---

These scenarios cover regular operations, error handling, and boundaries within the `encipher` method. Further tests could be carried out considering interactions between multiple methods, sequences of operations, and other error scenarios to comprehensively assure the module's reliability and robustness.
