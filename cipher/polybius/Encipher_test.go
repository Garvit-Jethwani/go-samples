================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: weak input validation
Issue: The use of the 'encipher' and 'decipher' functions without proper validation of character limits might allow the injecting of invalid characters or cause unhandled exceptions during encryption/decryption processes.
Solution: Implement comprehensive input validation in the 'encipher' and 'decipher' functions to ensure that all characters are within acceptable ranges and handle special character scenarios gracefully by returning specific errors.

Vulnerability: floating-point arithmetic in security-sensitive code
Issue: The use of 'math.Min' with floating-point arithmetic in the 'Decrypt' method could introduce inaccuracies or vulnerabilities potentially exploitable through crafted inputs that affect the arithmetic operations.
Solution: Replace floating-point arithmetic operations with integer calculations, and confirm the length of 'chars' contains an even number of elements before processing, throwing an error early if the check fails.

Vulnerability: case sensitive operations
Issue: Case conversion (ToUpper) is applied inconsistently across different functions like 'Decrypt', 'Encrypt', and initialization which might lead to logical errors or security issues when handling differently cased inputs.
Solution: Apply a consistent case conversion strategy throughout the code or clearly document the case expectations and validations for user inputs and internal processing.

================================================================================
Based on the contents of the `polybius.go` file, the function we are interested in is `encipher`, which is a method of the `Polybius` struct. The method enciphers a `rune` and returns a string along with an error if applicable. Below is an outline of testing scenarios for this function, considering the standard Go testing methodologies:

### Scenario 1: Encipher Valid Character
**Details:**
  Description: Test the `encipher` function with a valid character that exists in the key. It verifies if the function returns the correct encoded character.
  
**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create an instance of Polybius with predefined parameters including `key` and `characters`.
  Act: Call the encipher method on a valid character.
  Assert: Check if the output is as expected using `require.Equal`.

**Validation:**
  Justify: This test confirms that the `encipher` function operates correctly when provided a recognized character, which is its fundamental design purpose.
  Importance: Ensures the encipher method can successfully translate a character according to the key mapping, which is critical for the cipher to work properly.

### Scenario 2: Encipher Invalid Character
**Details:**
  Description: Examine the behavior of the `encipher` method when an invalid character (not in the key) is provided.
  
**Execution:**
  Arrange: Initialize a Polybius object with specific `key` and `characters`.
  Act: Call the encipher method on a character not present in the key.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an appropriate error using `require.Error` and `require.Contains` to check the error message.

**Validation:**
  Justify: It's crucial to ensure the function handles errors correctly if a non-existing character is used, as it assesses robustness against erroneous inputs.
  Importance: Critical for sustaining the application's stability and reliability, preventing cryptic errors during operation.

### Scenario 3: Encipher with Empty Character
**Details:**
  Description: Check how the `encipher` function behaves when provided an empty character.
  
**Execution:**
  Arrange: Setup a Polybius instnace.
  Act: Attempt to encipher an empty rune.
  Assert: Confirm that an error is returned, using `require.Error`.

**Validation:**
  Justify: Testing with empty input verifies that the function can gracefully handle unexpected input types, which might be an edge case.
  Importance: Validates the reliability of the cipher under unconventional conditions, enhancing the robustness of the encryption process.

These scenarios will collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of the `encipher` method under various conditions, ensuring it functions correctly and gracefully handles errors.
