================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the type or properties of 'char' before processing, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-rune types or unexpected values are passed.
Solution: Add explicit validation for 'char' to ensure it is a valid rune and meets expected criteria before processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function returns a generic error message that does not provide context about the nature of the error, potentially making debugging more difficult.
Solution: Modify the error handling to provide more specific messages or codes that can be easily interpreted and handled in upper layers.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Successful Encipher of a Character

Details:
  Description: This test checks the correct enciphering of a character that exists in the key. It aims to validate that the function computes the correct row and column, and returns the corresponding characters from the `characters` string.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Polybius` struct with a defined `size`, `characters`, and `key` where all elements are known and the test character exists in the `key`.
  Act: Call the `encipher` function with a character that is known to exist within the `key`.
  Assert: Check that the returned string matches the expected value based on the calculated row and column.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output from the encipher function matches the expected characters derived from the row and column calculations. This test is crucial for verifying the core functionality of the cipher system, ensuring that characters are correctly encoded based on the `key`.

### Scenario 2: Character Not Found in Key

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the error handling of the `encipher` function when a character that does not exist in the `key` is passed.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a `Polybius` struct with predefined `size`, `characters`, and `key`.
  Act: Invoke the `encipher` function with a character that is not present in the `key`.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns an error stating that the character does not exist in the key.

Validation:
  Utilizing Go's error checking to ensure that appropriate errors are thrown enhances robustness by handling cases where invalid input is provided. This test ensures that the system gracefully reports input errors, which is vital for debugging and user feedback in real-world applications.

### Scenario 3: Boundary Character in Key

Details:
  Description: Test the enciphering of a character at the boundary (either start or end) of the `key` to ensure indices are handled correctly.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Polybius` struct with a `key` and ensure the test character is at the start or end of the `key`.
  Act: Encipher the boundary character.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches expected characters derived from the boundary indices.

Validation:
  This test checks boundary conditions, which are often sources of bugs (e.g., off-by-one errors). It's essential to ensure that the algorithm correctly handles characters at the edges of the key range.

### Scenario 4: Encipher with Maximum Size Key

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the encipher function with the maximum possible size of the `key` based on the system or application constraints, ensuring that the function scales as expected.

Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a `Polybius` struct with the largest allowable `size`, filled `characters`, and `key`.
  Act: Encipher a character from this large `key`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct enciphered characters without performance degradation or errors.

Validation:
  Testing with maximum values is critical for assessing the scalability and performance boundaries of the function. This scenario ensures that the system remains reliable and efficient under high load or maximum capacity conditions.

### Scenario 5: Encipher with Minimal Size Key

Details:
  Description: Evaluate the function's behavior with the smallest non-trivial `size` of the `key`, which is typically 1 or 2, to ensure it handles small sizes correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `Polybius` struct with the smallest practical `size`, along with corresponding `characters` and `key`.
  Act: Encipher a character from this minimal `key`.
  Assert: Ensure the output is as expected for such a small key configuration.

Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can handle minimal configuration parameters, which might be common in certain constrained or simplified scenarios. It helps verify that no special cases or exceptions are needed for small sizes, maintaining consistency across different configurations.
