ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Encrypt_1491f1ee1a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The function appends encrypted characters to a string without limiting the size, potentially leading to excessive memory use if the input text is very large.
Solution: Implement a max input size limit for the text parameter or use a bytes.Buffer for more efficient concatenation.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function returns a generic error without specific details about the cause when enciphering fails, which can obscure the source of errors.
Solution: Enhance error handling by including more context or specific error messages from the encipher function in the returned error.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic successful encryption
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `Encrypt` function can successfully encrypt a simple text string without any errors, using a predefined key and character set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Polybius` struct with a specific size, characters, and key suitable for the test.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with a simple, known plaintext string.
  Assert: Check that the returned string matches the expected encrypted text and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the encryption logic correctly transforms the input text based on the provided key and character set. This test is crucial for verifying the basic functionality of the encryption process, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under normal conditions.

### Scenario 2: Encryption with non-existent characters
Details:
  Description: Test how the `Encrypt` function handles characters that are not present in the specified character set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Polybius` struct with a certain character set that excludes some common characters.
  Act: Invoke the `Encrypt` function with a string containing characters not present in the character set.
  Assert: Expect an error to be returned, indicating the failure in the encryption process due to non-existent characters.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages when encountering characters that cannot be encrypted with the given settings. It helps maintain robustness and reliability in the face of unexpected inputs.

### Scenario 3: Empty input string
Details:
  Description: Verify that the `Encrypt` function handles an empty string input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Polybius` struct with any valid configuration.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with an empty string.
  Assert: The function should return an empty string and no error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function can handle edge cases like empty input gracefully. It's important for the function to handle such cases without failing, as empty inputs might be a valid scenario in usage contexts.

### Scenario 4: Case insensitivity
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the `Encrypt` function is case insensitive by providing input in varying cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `Polybius` struct with a known configuration.
  Act: Encrypt strings in different cases (lowercase, uppercase, mixed).
  Assert: All outputs should be identical regardless of the input case and should not return an error.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the encryption process is case insensitive, which is crucial for user experience and consistency. It ensures that the function's behavior aligns with typical expectations for text-based operations where case should not alter the outcome.

### Scenario 5: Large input string
Details:
  Description: Test the `Encrypt` function's performance and correctness with a very large input string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Polybius` struct with a suitable configuration.
  Act: Encrypt a large string (e.g., several thousand characters long).
  Assert: The function should successfully return the encrypted text without any performance issues or errors.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the scalability and efficiency of the encryption algorithm. Ensuring that the function can handle large inputs without degradation is essential for applications that may need to process significant amounts of data.

### Scenario 6: Invalid `Polybius` configuration
Details:
  Description: Check how the `Encrypt` function behaves when the `Polybius` struct is configured with invalid parameters (e.g., empty character set or key).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Polybius` struct with invalid settings (e.g., empty `characters`).
  Act: Attempt to encrypt any string.
  Assert: Expect an error indicating that the encryption cannot proceed due to invalid configuration.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle incorrect configurations by failing early and informing the user, which is critical for preventing more complex errors in the system and ensuring data integrity.
