ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_fd32ff45fc

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
Issue: The code uses 'text[i+key[j]-1]' which can access out-of-bounds memory if 'key[j]' is not correctly bounded or if 'key' contains inappropriate values.
Solution: Validate the values in 'key' to ensure they are within the bounds of 'text'. Consider adding checks to confirm that 'key[j]' values are within the range of 0 to 'keyLength-1'.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate that the 'keyWord' parameter translates to a valid 'key' array, potentially leading to runtime panics or logical errors.
Solution: Implement validation for 'keyWord' to ensure that it can only generate valid keys. This could involve checking the character set and length of 'keyWord'.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function assumes 'textLength' and 'keyLength' are positive after their checks, but does not consider zero-length 'key' which results in division by zero in 'n := textLength % keyLength'.
Solution: Add an explicit check for 'keyLength' being zero before calculating 'n' to avoid division by zero errors.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Successful Decryption with Valid Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `Decrypt` function correctly decrypts a text using a valid keyWord. The test checks if the function outputs the expected decrypted text when provided with a properly formatted input and a correct key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a slice of runes that represent an encrypted text and a valid keyWord.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` function with the encrypted text and the keyWord.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected decrypted text.
Validation:
  The assertion will validate that the function returns the correct decrypted text, which is crucial for ensuring the decryption algorithm's accuracy. This test is important to confirm that the function handles normal inputs correctly and produces the expected output, maintaining the integrity and usability of the decryption process.

### Scenario 2: Error Handling for Empty Text

Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that the `Decrypt` function returns an error when an empty slice of runes is passed as the text. This test checks the function's ability to handle and report errors due to insufficient input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty slice of runes and a valid keyWord.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the appropriate error (`ErrNoTextToEncrypt`).
Validation:
  The test validates that the function is robust against invalid input cases by returning a specific error, helping in early detection and handling of such cases in the application. It stresses the importance of input validation in cryptographic functions.

### Scenario 3: Error Handling for Missing KeyWord

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the `Decrypt` function's response when provided with a valid text but an empty keyWord. It checks whether the function appropriately handles a missing or invalid decryption key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a non-empty slice of runes representing the text and an empty string for the keyWord.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns the `ErrKeyMissing` error.
Validation:
  Asserting this specific error response confirms that the function properly enforces key requirements. This is essential for maintaining the security and functionality of the decryption process, as decryption without a valid key should not proceed.

### Scenario 4: Handling of Placeholder Characters in Decryption

Details:
  Description: Verify that the `Decrypt` function correctly removes any placeholder characters added during the encryption process for alignment purposes, returning only the meaningful decrypted text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a slice of runes that includes placeholder characters at calculated positions and a corresponding valid keyWord.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned text is free of placeholders and matches the expected meaningful text.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the decryption process correctly reconstructs the original text by removing any non-original characters used during encryption. It is crucial for the accuracy and cleanliness of the output, aligning with user expectations and data integrity.

### Scenario 5: Decryption with Partial Block of Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle and correctly decrypt texts whose lengths are not a multiple of the key length, necessitating the use of placeholders.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes representing an encrypted text with a length that is not a multiple of the key length, along with a valid keyWord.
  Act: Decrypt the text using the `Decrypt` function.
  Assert: Verify that the decrypted text is correct and does not include any placeholders.
Validation:
  The aim here is to validate the function's handling of irregular text lengths, ensuring that it correctly pads and subsequently removes any placeholders, yielding the correct original text. This scenario is vital for the function's flexibility and reliability across various text inputs.
