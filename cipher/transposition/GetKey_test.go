================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The use of 'sort.Slice' can potentially lead to unpredictable behavior if not properly handled, especially with concurrent accesses.
Solution: Ensure that 'sort.Slice' is used in a context where the slice is not accessed concurrently or use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes to protect the slice during sorting.

Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The function 'getIndex' is called without validation that the index it returns does not exceed array bounds, which could lead to runtime panics.
Solution: Validate the return value of 'getIndex' to ensure it is within the bounds of 'sortedWord' before using it as an index.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: There is no check for an empty input string to 'getKey', which could result in unexpected behavior or runtime errors.
Solution: Add a check at the start of 'getKey' to return an appropriate error or default value if 'keyWord' is empty.

================================================================================
### Test Scenarios for `getKey` Function

#### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality with Unique Characters
Details:
  - Description: Test the basic functionality of the `getKey` function with a keyword where all characters are unique.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use the keyword "dog".
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with the keyword.
    - Assert: Check that the output matches the expected index positions of the sorted characters.
  - Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the resulting slice `[3, 1, 2]` matches the expected indexes of 'd', 'g', 'o' in "dgo".
    - It is important to test this to ensure that basic alphabetical sorting and indexing are functioning correctly.

#### Scenario 2: Handling Case Insensitivity
Details:
  - Description: Ensure that `getKey` handles case insensitivity by treating upper and lower case letters as the same.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use the keyword "CaT".
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with the keyword.
    - Assert: Check that the output is the same as it would be for "cat".
  - Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the output `[3, 1, 2]` is consistent regardless of the case of the input.
    - This test verifies the function's ability to handle different cases, which is crucial for user input variability.

#### Scenario 3: Characters with Duplicates
Details:
  - Description: Verify that `getKey` correctly handles keywords with duplicate characters.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use the keyword "breeze".
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with the keyword.
    - Assert: Check that the positions reflect the correct order and duplication handling.
  - Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the resulting array `[2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3]` correctly reflects the sorted order "beeezr".
    - Testing duplicate characters is essential as it tests the function's robustness in maintaining character order and frequency.

#### Scenario 4: Empty String Input
Details:
  - Description: Test how `getKey` behaves when passed an empty string.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use an empty string.
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with the empty string.
    - Assert: Ensure the returned slice is empty.
  - Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the function returns an empty slice, which is expected behavior for empty input.
    - This test is important to confirm that the function gracefully handles lack of input, which is a common edge case.

#### Scenario 5: Non-Alphabetic Characters
Details:
  - Description: Test the function with input that includes numbers and symbols to see if it only sorts alphabet characters.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use the keyword "hello123!@#".
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with this keyword.
    - Assert: Verify that the function processes the alphabetic characters correctly ignoring others.
  - Validation:
    - The assertion would check for correct processing of "hello" as the non-alphabetic characters should ideally be ignored.
    - This test checks the function's ability to ignore non-alphabetical characters, focusing on relevant data.

#### Scenario 6: Long String Input
Details:
  - Description: Test the function's performance and correctness with a very long string.
  - Execution:
    - Arrange: Use a long repeated pattern keyword like "abracadabra" * 100.
    - Act: Invoke `getKey` with this keyword.
    - Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct sequence and handles large input efficiently.
  - Validation:
    - The assertion would check for the correct and consistent pattern in the output, ensuring performance isn't compromised.
    - It's crucial to test the function with large inputs to ensure scalability and efficiency in real-world applications.
