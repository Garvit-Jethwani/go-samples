ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Encrypt_caf9259176

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The calculation 'textLength % keyLength' and subsequent loop 'for i := 0; i < keyLength-n; i++' could result in an integer overflow if 'keyLength' is very large.
Solution: Add checks to ensure 'keyLength' does not exceed a safe threshold. Consider using 'math/big' for large integers.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: Use of 'fmt.Errorf' with '%w' for error wrapping includes detailed internal state, which could leak sensitive information if errors are exposed to users or logs.
Solution: Create custom error types that do not expose sensitive information or use logging levels to control error output granularity.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate that 'key' contains unique indices or that indices are within bounds for 'transposition', which can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect encryption.
Solution: Validate 'key' to ensure all indices are unique and within the valid range before using it for transposition.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The encryption key is derived from a 'keyWord' that might be guessable or hard-coded, reducing the cryptographic strength.
Solution: Use a secure method to generate or retrieve keys, such as integrating with a key management system.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Encryption Test

**Details:**
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `Encrypt` function with a normal text and a valid key. It ensures that the function correctly transposes the text based on the key provided.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Provide a slice of runes representing the text "hello" and a keyword "key".
  - Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with these parameters.
  - Assert: Check if the output is as expected after the transposition based on the key.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion will validate that the transposition logic is implemented correctly and that the function handles standard input properly.
  - This test is important to confirm that basic encryption logic is working as intended, which is central to the functionality of the application.

### Scenario 2: Key Length Exceeds Text Length

**Details:**
  Description: This test ensures that the `Encrypt` function can handle cases where the key length is greater than the length of the text.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Provide a short text "hi" and a longer keyword "longkey".
  - Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with these parameters.
  - Assert: Verify that the function still returns a valid encrypted text, possibly padded with placeholders.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion checks that the function can handle and correctly process inputs where the key length exceeds the text length.
  - This scenario is significant for ensuring the robustness of the application in handling various input sizes.

### Scenario 3: Text Ends with Placeholder

**Details:**
  Description: This scenario tests the function's error handling when the text ends with a placeholder character, which should not be allowed.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Provide a text "hello_" (assuming '_' is the placeholder) and a valid keyword "key".
  - Act: Call the `Encrypt` function.
  - Assert: Expect an error indicating that encryption cannot proceed with a text ending in a placeholder.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion confirms that the function properly identifies and rejects texts ending with a placeholder, preventing potential encryption errors or data corruption.
  - It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that placeholders are handled correctly.

### Scenario 4: Empty Text Input

**Details:**
  Description: Verifies that the function returns an error when attempting to encrypt an empty text.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Provide an empty text slice and a valid keyword "key".
  - Act: Call the `Encrypt` function.
  - Assert: Expect an error that no text is available for encryption.

**Validation:**
  - This test checks the function's ability to handle and report empty text inputs, which are not valid for encryption.
  - Ensuring that empty inputs are caught and handled appropriately is necessary to avoid unnecessary processing and potential errors in the application.

### Scenario 5: Missing Keyword

**Details:**
  Description: Tests the function's response to a missing or empty keyword, which is necessary for the encryption process.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Provide a normal text "hello" and an empty keyword.
  - Act: Call the `Encrypt` function.
  - Assert: Expect an error indicating that the keyword is missing.

**Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function cannot proceed without a valid keyword and correctly identifies this issue.
  - This test is important for security and functionality, as the keyword is essential for the encryption process, and its absence should be explicitly handled.
