================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The function getIndex uses a linear search, which can be inefficient for large datasets, leading to potential performance issues.
Solution: Replace the linear search with a more efficient searching algorithm like binary search, or use a map if the elements are hashable for O(1) average-time complexity.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: The getIndex function returns 0 if the substring is not found, which is ambiguous because 0 is a valid index.
Solution: Modify the function to return -1 if the substring is not found, to clearly distinguish between not found and found at index 0.

### Test Scenarios for `getIndex` Function

#### Scenario 1: Substring Found in WordSet
Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly identifies the position of a rune in the slice when the rune exists within the slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes containing multiple elements, including the target rune.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with the rune slice and the target rune.
  Assert: Verify that the returned index matches the expected index of the rune in the slice.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the index returned by the function against the known index of the rune in the manually defined slice. This test is crucial to ensure the function can locate an existing rune correctly, which is a fundamental requirement for any operations relying on rune position.

#### Scenario 2: Substring Not Found in WordSet
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 0 when the rune is not present in the slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes that does not include the target rune.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with the rune slice and a rune that is not part of the slice.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 0.
Validation:
  The function is expected to return 0 for any rune not found in the slice. This test ensures that the function handles cases of missing runes correctly, which is necessary to prevent incorrect indexing in the application.

#### Scenario 3: Empty WordSet
Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when an empty rune slice is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of runes.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with the empty slice and any rune.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Given that there are no elements to search through, the function should return 0. This test is important to confirm that the function gracefully handles empty input, which is a basic but crucial aspect of robust software.

#### Scenario 4: First Element Match
Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly returns the index of a rune that matches the first element in the slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes where the first element is the target rune.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with this slice and the target rune.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned index is 0, as it is the first element.
Validation:
  Checking the return of 0 in this scenario validates that the function accurately identifies runes located at the start of a slice. This test is essential for operations where the first element has specific significance.

#### Scenario 5: Last Element Match
Details:
  Description: Test to ensure the function correctly identifies the index of a rune located at the end of the slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes where the last element is the target rune.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with this slice and the target rune.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned index corresponds to the last position in the slice.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can correctly identify the position of runes at any place within the slice, including the end. This capability is important for comprehensive search functionality within the application.

#### Scenario 6: Unicode Characters Handling
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle and correctly index Unicode characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of runes that includes Unicode characters.
  Act: Call `getIndex` with this slice and a specific Unicode character.
  Assert: Verify that the returned index is correct according to the Unicode character's position.
Validation:
  The ability to handle Unicode characters correctly is essential for applications supporting internationalization. This test ensures that the function is robust and versatile in handling diverse character sets.
