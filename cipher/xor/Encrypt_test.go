================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The XOR encryption used is a weak cryptographic method and can be easily broken with simple frequency analysis if the key is reused or is too short.
Solution: Replace XOR with a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES. Use the 'crypto/aes' package for implementing AES.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the 'key' byte is not random or is predictable, the encryption can be easily compromised.
Solution: Ensure that the encryption key is generated using a secure random number generator, such as those provided by 'crypto/rand' package.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Using a single byte key exposes the data to risk of recovery through repeated patterns, especially with longer plaintexts.
Solution: Use a longer key that changes periodically or per session to mitigate pattern exposure and enhance security.

### Test Scenarios for the `Encrypt` Function in the `xor` Package

#### Scenario 1: Encrypting a non-empty plaintext with a non-zero key

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `Encrypt` function by using a non-zero encryption key and a non-empty plaintext. It verifies whether the function correctly applies the XOR operation between the key and each byte of the plaintext.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a byte key (e.g., `0x1F`) and a plaintext byte slice (e.g., `[]byte("hello")`).
  Act: Call `Encrypt(key, plaintext)` to encrypt the plaintext.
  Assert: Check if the returned ciphertext matches the expected result, which is manually calculated by applying XOR between the key and each byte of the plaintext.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the XOR encryption logic is correctly implemented and produces the expected transformation of the input data. This test is crucial for ensuring the basic encryption mechanism works as intended.

#### Scenario 2: Encrypting with a zero key

Details:
  Description: Tests the encryption function using a zero key, which should return the original plaintext, as XOR with zero leaves the original value unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a byte key as `0x00` and a sample plaintext byte slice (e.g., `[]byte("test")`).
  Act: Call `Encrypt(key, plaintext)`.
  Assert: Verify that the ciphertext equals the plaintext.
Validation:
  Asserting that the output matches the input when the key is zero confirms that the XOR operation is applied correctly across all bytes. This scenario is important to verify that edge cases involving zero values are handled properly.

#### Scenario 3: Encrypting an empty plaintext

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the `Encrypt` function can handle an empty input array gracefully without errors or unexpected behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Utilize a non-zero key (e.g., `0x1A`) and an empty plaintext byte slice (`[]byte{}`).
  Act: Call `Encrypt(key, plaintext)`.
  Assert: Ensure the returned ciphertext is also an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in dealing with empty inputs, which is a common edge case in real-world applications. Proper handling of such cases helps prevent runtime errors.

#### Scenario 4: Encrypting with special characters in plaintext

Details:
  Description: Verify that the `Encrypt` function correctly encrypts plaintext containing special characters and non-ASCII values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a key (e.g., `0x2B`) and a plaintext that includes special characters (`[]byte("data!@#$%^&*()")`).
  Act: Encrypt the plaintext using the given key.
  Assert: Compare the output to manually computed XOR results of the plaintext and the key.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the encryption logic accurately processes bytes regardless of their values, which is vital for the reliability and universality of the encryption function.

#### Scenario 5: Encrypting with maximum byte value for key

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the maximum possible byte value (`0xFF`) is used as the key, which should flip all bits of the plaintext.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the key to `0xFF` and define a plaintext (`[]byte("flip")`).
  Act: Call `Encrypt(key, plaintext)`.
  Assert: Verify the ciphertext is the bitwise NOT of the original plaintext.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the boundary condition of the key's value range, ensuring the function performs as expected even at extreme input values. It's critical for assessing the function's stability and correctness under varied conditions.
