ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_bce26797fd

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The XOR encryption method used is weak and can be easily broken if the key or pattern is known or can be guessed.
Solution: Use a more secure encryption algorithm like AES. Go provides this in the 'crypto/aes' package.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Consumption
Issue: The function continuously appends to the slice which can lead to excessive memory usage if the cipherText is very large.
Solution: Preallocate the slice with the required capacity using make([]byte, 0, len(cipherText)) to improve memory efficiency and control.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Using a single byte key for XOR may lead to easy recovery of the key if multiple ciphertexts are available, or if plaintext structures are known.
Solution: Enhance key complexity and length, or use a key derivation function to generate a more secure key.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Decrypt with Simple Key and Cipher Text

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `Decrypt` function correctly decrypts a cipher text that was encrypted using a simple XOR operation with a known key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a known key and a cipher text that is the result of XORing the plain text with the same key.
  Act: Invoke the `Decrypt` function with the provided key and cipher text.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the original plain text.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on direct comparison of the decrypted byte slice with the original plain text. This test validates the core functionality of the XOR decryption logic, ensuring that the function correctly reverses the encryption process.

### Scenario 2: Decrypt with Empty Cipher Text

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `Decrypt` function handles an empty cipher text correctly, returning an empty slice without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a random key and an empty slice for the cipher text.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for an empty result, which is expected when decrypting an empty cipher text. This test is important to confirm that the function handles edge cases of input data gracefully.

### Scenario 3: Decrypt with Null Key

Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that using a key of 0 (null key) in the `Decrypt` function results in the cipher text being returned unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the key to 0 and provide a non-empty cipher text.
  Act: Decrypt the cipher text using the null key.
  Assert: The output should be identical to the input cipher text.
Validation:
  Since XORing any value with 0 yields the same value, the output should match the input. This test verifies that the function correctly applies the XOR operation even with a null key, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior under different key values.

### Scenario 4: Decrypt with All Possible Byte Values for Key

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the `Decrypt` function with every possible byte value as a key to ensure consistent behavior across all potential keys.
Execution:
  Arrange: Iterate over all possible byte values (0-255) and a fixed cipher text.
  Act: For each key, decrypt the cipher text.
  Assert: Each output is validated to ensure it correctly decrypts the cipher text according to the XOR logic.
Validation:
  This comprehensive testing across all byte values ensures that there are no anomalies or unexpected behaviors for any key value. It's vital for confirming the robustness of the decryption logic.

### Scenario 5: Decrypt with Non-ASCII Characters

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the `Decrypt` function can handle cipher texts containing non-ASCII characters correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a key and a cipher text containing non-ASCII byte values.
  Act: Decrypt the cipher text using the provided key.
  Assert: Verify that the decrypted text matches the expected plain text.
Validation:
  The function should handle any byte values correctly, not just ASCII characters. This test checks the function's ability to work with a wider range of byte values, which is crucial for applications dealing with various data types.

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and potential error conditions to ensure that the `Decrypt` function behaves as expected under various circumstances.
