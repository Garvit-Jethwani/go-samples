================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
Issue: The code imports a package from an external source (GitHub), which could be potentially harmful if the repository is compromised.
Solution: Ensure the external libraries are from trusted sources, consider using dependency pinning to a specific, reviewed version of the library, and routinely audit these dependencies.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The function 'rot13' does not handle errors which might arise from the 'caesar.Encrypt' function, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unhandled exceptions.
Solution: Implement error handling within the 'rot13' function to manage possible exceptions from 'caesar.Encrypt', and ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

================================================================================
### Test Scenarios for the `rot13` function in the `rot13` package

#### Scenario 1: Basic functionality with lowercase alphabets

Details:
  Description: Test to check if the function correctly translates a string of lowercase alphabetic characters using the ROT13 cipher.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a simple lowercase string, e.g., "hello".
  Act: Invoke the `rot13` function with the arranged string.
  Assert: Check if the output is "uryyb" which is the expected ROT13 transformation of "hello".
Validation:
  The assertion validates that each character in the input string is shifted by 13 positions in the alphabet. This test is crucial for verifying the basic functionality of the ROT13 cipher implementation.

#### Scenario 2: Basic functionality with uppercase alphabets

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function handles uppercase letters correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an uppercase string, e.g., "HELLO".
  Act: Call the `rot13` function with this string.
  Assert: The expected output should be "URYYB".
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can correctly handle and transform uppercase characters. It's important for applications that may process texts with mixed or all-uppercase letters.

#### Scenario 3: Numeric and special characters handling

Details:
  Description: Verify that numeric and special characters remain unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string containing numbers and special characters, e.g., "hello123!@#".
  Act: Invoke the `rot13` function with the provided string.
  Assert: The result should be "uryyb123!@#".
Validation:
  Since ROT13 should only affect alphabetic characters, this scenario checks that other types of characters remain unaffected, ensuring the cipher's correctness and robustness in diverse inputs.

#### Scenario 4: Empty string input

Details:
  Description: Check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string "".
  Act: Call the `rot13` function with the empty string.
  Assert: The output should also be an empty string "".
Validation:
  Testing with an empty string ensures that the function gracefully handles lack of input without errors, which is important for stability and reliability.

#### Scenario 5: String with mixed character types

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function properly encrypts strings that include a mixture of upper, lower, numeric, and special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A complex string such as "Hello, World! 123".
  Act: Call the `rot13` function with this string.
  Assert: The expected result should be "Uryyb, Jbeyq! 123".
Validation:
  This scenario tests the cipher's ability to correctly process and transform mixed-type strings, which is crucial for real-world usage where input variability is common.

#### Scenario 6: Long text input

Details:
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness over a long text input.
Execution:
  Arrange: A long string composed of multiple sentences or paragraphs.
  Act: Invoke the `rot13` function with the long text.
  Assert: Validate that the output is the ROT13 transformation of the entire text without truncation or errors.
Validation:
  This test checks for potential issues in handling large inputs, such as memory management and processing time, ensuring the function is robust and scalable.

By covering these scenarios, we ensure that the `rot13` function handles a variety of common and edge cases efficiently and correctly, maintaining the integrity and utility of the ROT13 cipher application.
