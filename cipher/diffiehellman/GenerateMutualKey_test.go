ROOST_METHOD_HASH=GenerateMutualKey_6d5e3b3433
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GenerateMutualKey_47263a2d29

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
Issue: Use of static or predictable prime numbers in cryptographic operations can lead to predictable outputs, making the system vulnerable to attacks such as reverse engineering the key.
Solution: Use a secure method to generate a large random prime number for each key exchange session.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The modularExponentiation function's effectiveness and security depend on its implementation, which is not shown. If implemented poorly, it can lead to vulnerabilities such as timing attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the modularExponentiation function uses constant-time algorithms to prevent timing attacks and consider using established libraries like 'crypto/rsa' for cryptographic operations.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: There is no validation for the input parameters (prvKey, shareKey). Invalid or malicious inputs could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the provided keys are within expected ranges and conform to expected formats.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If exceptions or errors in the key generation process are not handled properly, they could leak sensitive information about the internal state or key material.
Solution: Implement proper error handling around cryptographic operations to prevent information leakage and provide generic error messages to the user.

### Test Scenarios for the `GenerateMutualKey` Function in the `diffiehellman` Package

#### Scenario 1: Valid Keys and Prime Number
Details:
  Description: Test the `GenerateMutualKey` function with valid private and shared keys to ensure it computes the mutual key correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define valid `prvKey` and `shareKey` integers.
  Act: Call the `GenerateMutualKey` function with these keys.
  Assert: Verify that the returned mutual key is as expected based on known mathematical outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function correctly implements the cryptographic mutual key generation using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange principle. This test is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of the mutual key computation.

#### Scenario 2: Zero Private Key
Details:
  Description: Evaluate how the function handles a scenario where the private key is zero, which is a potential edge case in cryptographic functions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `prvKey` to zero and a valid `shareKey`.
  Act: Invoke the `GenerateMutualKey` function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles this input correctly, potentially returning a specific error or result.
Validation:
  This test checks robustness against potentially invalid or insecure input values. Ensuring that edge cases like a zero private key are handled correctly is important for maintaining the reliability and security of the cryptographic process.

#### Scenario 3: Negative Private Key
Details:
  Description: Check the function's response to a negative private key, which is generally not valid in cryptographic operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a negative value to `prvKey` and provide a valid `shareKey`.
  Act: Execute the `GenerateMutualKey` function.
  Assert: Assess whether the function properly rejects or handles negative values.
Validation:
  Testing with a negative private key verifies that the function enforces appropriate input constraints and maintains cryptographic security standards. Handling such cases prevents undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

#### Scenario 4: Large Prime Number
Details:
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness with very large prime numbers, which are common in real-world cryptographic applications.
Execution:
  Arrange: Utilize very large values for `prvKey`, `shareKey`, and `primeNumber`.
  Act: Call the `GenerateMutualKey` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns the correct mutual key and performs efficiently.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm under conditions typical in secure communications. It also helps verify that the function can handle large integers without overflow or performance degradation.

#### Scenario 5: Identical Private and Shared Keys
Details:
  Description: Verify the function's output when the private and shared keys are identical, which might be a special case in some implementations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both `prvKey` and `shareKey` to the same non-zero value.
  Act: Invoke the `GenerateMutualKey` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function computes the mutual key correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where input parameters are identical, which is important for ensuring consistent cryptographic behavior across different input scenarios.

Each of these scenarios plays a crucial role in verifying different aspects of the `GenerateMutualKey` function, from handling edge cases to ensuring performance with large values, thereby ensuring the overall robustness and reliability of cryptographic operations within the application.
