ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Encrypt_db24fc6362

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues
Issue: The use of int64 for the public exponent and modulus in RSA encryption can lead to cryptographic weaknesses due to limited value range and potential for overflow.
Solution: Use the 'big.Int' type from the 'math/big' package for handling large numbers securely in cryptographic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: Implementing RSA encryption manually without proper cryptographic review can introduce vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks.
Solution: Utilize a well-reviewed cryptographic library that provides RSA implementation, such as 'crypto/rsa' from the Go standard library.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Lack of validation for 'publicExponent' and 'modulus' could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities if they are zero or negative.
Solution: Add checks to ensure 'publicExponent' and 'modulus' are positive integers before performing encryption operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning a generic error 'ErrorFailedToEncrypt' without context may not provide enough information for proper debugging and error handling.
Solution: Enhance error messages to include context-specific information while ensuring sensitive data is not exposed.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Encryption Success

**Details:**
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `Encrypt` function with a standard input message and valid public exponent and modulus values. The goal is to ensure that the function correctly encrypts a simple message without any errors.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Provide a small array of runes representing a simple message, along with valid public exponent and modulus values.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned slice of runes is not nil, and no error is returned. Additionally, verify that the output matches the expected encrypted values.

**Validation:**
  The choice of assertion is based on verifying both the correctness of the output (encrypted message) and the absence of any errors during the process. This test is crucial for confirming that the basic encryption process works as expected, which is fundamental to the application's security features.

### Scenario 2: Input With Non-ASCII Characters

**Details:**
  Description: Test the `Encrypt` function's ability to handle non-ASCII characters. Non-ASCII characters can have different byte lengths which might affect the encryption process.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Provide a message array containing non-ASCII characters (e.g., emojis, accented characters).
  Act: Invoke the `Encrypt` function with the message and valid encryption parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an encrypted message without errors.

**Validation:**
  Asserting the absence of errors and checking the encrypted result ensures that the function can handle Unicode characters correctly. This test is important to verify the versatility and robustness of the encryption function in a globalized application context.

### Scenario 3: Large Inputs

**Details:**
  Description: Evaluate the performance and correctness of the `Encrypt` function when dealing with large input messages to ensure it scales well and remains efficient.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create a large array of runes (e.g., a long text or repeated pattern).
  Act: Execute the `Encrypt` function with this large message and appropriate public exponent and modulus.
  Assert: Confirm that the function completes within a reasonable time and without errors, and that the output is correctly encrypted.

**Validation:**
  This test checks the efficiency and scalability of the encryption function, which is critical for applications that may need to handle large volumes of data securely.

### Scenario 4: Zero and Negative Values for Public Exponent and Modulus

**Details:**
  Description: Test how the `Encrypt` function handles edge cases such as zero or negative values for the public exponent or modulus, which are not valid in RSA encryption.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Provide valid message input but set the public exponent or modulus to zero or a negative number.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Expect an error to be returned, and no encrypted message should be generated.

**Validation:**
  This scenario is essential to ensure the function robustly handles invalid input parameters and maintains the security invariant by not proceeding with encryption under these conditions.

### Scenario 5: Modular Exponentiation Failure

**Details:**
  Description: Ensure that the `Encrypt` function correctly handles and propagates errors from the `modular.Exponentiation` function.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Mock the `modular.Exponentiation` to return an error for specific inputs.
  Act: Invoke the `Encrypt` function with parameters that trigger the mock error.
  Assert: Check that the expected error is returned and no encrypted message is produced.

**Validation:**
  This test is crucial for confirming that error handling within the `Encrypt` function works correctly, ensuring that any lower-level errors do not silently affect the application's behavior, maintaining robustness and reliability.
