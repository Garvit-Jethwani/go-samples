ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_f4629916a9

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate whether the provided privateExponent and modulus are appropriate for RSA decryption, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect decryption.
Solution: Implement input validation for privateExponent and modulus to ensure they meet the cryptographic requirements of RSA. This may include checks for non-zero, positive integers and ensuring modulus is appropriate for the key size.

Vulnerability: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
Issue: The use of deterministic functions like modular exponentiation without randomness in the decryption process may lead to predictable cryptographic operations vulnerable to attacks.
Solution: Integrate secure randomization where applicable or ensure that the cryptographic operations adhere to practices that include randomness to avoid predictability.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The code directly implements RSA decryption without specifying the use of secure padding schemes, which are essential to prevent vulnerabilities such as padding oracle attacks.
Solution: Utilize a well-established library that supports RSA with OAEP padding to ensure decryption is secure against various cryptographic attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues
Issue: Dependency on an external library ('github.com/TheAlgorithms/Go/math/modular') for a critical cryptographic function increases risk if the library is not maintained or has vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure the external library is actively maintained and audited for security issues. Consider alternatives like standard libraries if possible.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Successful Decryption
Details:
  Description: This test checks the normal operation of the `Decrypt` function where the input parameters are correctly set for a successful decryption of the encrypted data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a slice of runes representing encrypted data, along with a valid private exponent and modulus.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the output is the expected decrypted string and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the output matches the expected decrypted string and confirms no error occurred, validating the correct implementation of the RSA decryption process. This test is crucial as it verifies the fundamental functionality of the decryption process, ensuring that users can reliably decrypt data.

### Scenario 2: Decryption with Empty Input
Details:
  Description: Test the behavior of the `Decrypt` function when provided with an empty slice of runes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty slice of runes, and any arbitrary valid private exponent and modulus.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the output is an empty string and no error is returned.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that handling empty input gracefully is crucial for robustness. It ensures that the system can manage edge cases without crashing or behaving unpredictably.

### Scenario 3: Decryption with Invalid Modulus
Details:
  Description: Examines the function's error-handling capability when an invalid modulus (such as zero) is used, which should lead to a mathematical error in modular exponentiation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a valid encrypted input and private exponent, but set modulus to zero.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Expect an error indicating failure to decrypt.
Validation:
  The test validates that the function properly handles errors from the modular exponentiation function, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of the decryption process. It's important to ensure that the system can gracefully handle and report errors that occur during decryption.

### Scenario 4: Decryption with Negative Exponents
Details:
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with a negative private exponent, which is technically valid in certain contexts but unusual.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a slice of encrypted data and a negative private exponent, with a valid modulus.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify the output and that no error is returned (assuming modular exponentiation can handle negative exponents).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the modular exponentiation and decryption logic when faced with less typical but valid inputs. Ensuring that negative exponents are handled correctly is important for the flexibility and correctness of the cryptographic operations.

### Scenario 5: Decryption Process Encounters an Internal Error
Details:
  Description: Simulates an internal error in the modular exponentiation to test the error propagation in the `Decrypt` function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `modular.Exponentiation` function to return an error for specific inputs.
  Act: Call the `Decrypt` function with inputs that trigger the mocked error.
  Assert: Verify that the correct error is returned from the `Decrypt` function.
Validation:
  By asserting that the `Decrypt` function propagates errors from the modular exponentiation correctly, this test ensures that the function can handle and communicate failures effectively, which is essential for error handling and troubleshooting in a production environment.
