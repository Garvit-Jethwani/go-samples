================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incomplete Code
Issue: The import statement in the package is empty and the Encrypt function is not defined within the provided code snippet, leading to a compilation error.
Solution: Ensure that all necessary packages are imported correctly and that the Encrypt function is either defined in the same package or imported from an external package.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Encryption Parameters
Issue: Using a fixed subtraction for the encryption key (26-key) could lead to predictable cryptographic operations, making the encryption less secure.
Solution: Implement a more dynamic key management system or use a more secure encryption algorithm that does not rely on simple transformations.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic decryption with a positive key
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `Decrypt` function correctly decrypts a simple string encrypted with a positive key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a string that has been shifted with a known key.
  Act: Call `Decrypt` with the encrypted string and the same key used for encryption.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the original string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if decryption reverses the encryption correctly. This test is crucial to ensure the basic functionality of the `Decrypt` function, which is fundamental for the security features of the application.

### Scenario 2: Decryption with key zero
Details:
  Description: This test ensures that using a key of zero returns the original string unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a sample string and a key of zero.
  Act: Call `Decrypt` with this string and key.
  Assert: The output should be identical to the input string.
Validation:
  A key of zero implies no shift in the Caesar cipher, so the output should be the same as the input. This test verifies that the function handles this edge case correctly, maintaining data integrity when no encryption shift is intended.

### Scenario 3: Decryption with maximum key value (25)
Details:
  Description: Test the decryption process using the maximum possible key value (25), which should yield a complete reversal of the alphabet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an encrypted string with a key of 25.
  Act: Decrypt this string using the key 25.
  Assert: The output should match the original string before encryption.
Validation:
  Since the Caesar cipher's maximum shift is effectively the length of the alphabet minus one, this test ensures that the boundary condition is handled correctly. It's important for ensuring the robustness of decryption across all valid key values.

### Scenario 4: Decryption with a negative key
Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles a negative decryption key by effectively calculating the positive equivalent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Encrypt a string with a positive key and attempt to decrypt it with the corresponding negative key.
  Act: Decrypt the string using the negative key.
  Assert: The decrypted string should match the original string.
Validation:
  While the Caesar cipher traditionally uses positive keys, handling negative keys correctly can prevent errors when keys are dynamically calculated or incorrectly input. This test ensures the function's resilience and correctness under such conditions.

### Scenario 5: Decryption of an empty string
Details:
  Description: Ensure that decrypting an empty string with any key returns an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string and any random key.
  Act: Decrypt the empty string using the given key.
  Assert: The result should be an empty string.
Validation:
  Decrypting an empty string should result in an empty string regardless of the key. This test verifies that the function handles empty inputs gracefully without errors or unexpected behavior.

### Scenario 6: Decryption with a non-alphabetic string
Details:
  Description: Test the decryption of a string containing numbers and special characters to see if they are unaffected by the decryption process.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string containing a mix of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, encrypted with a known key.
  Act: Decrypt this string using the corresponding decryption key.
  Assert: Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged, while alphabetic characters should be correctly decrypted.
Validation:
  This scenario checks if the function properly skips non-alphabetic characters, focusing only on letters. This is essential for handling text with mixed content, ensuring that the decryption process is accurate and reliable for textual data.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `Decrypt` function behaves as expected under various conditions, covering both typical use cases and edge cases. This comprehensive testing approach helps in building a robust application with reliable cryptographic features.
