================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The Caesar cipher is inherently insecure as it offers very weak encryption, which can be easily broken with basic frequency analysis.
Solution: Replace the Caesar cipher with a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Use the 'crypto/aes' package in Go for implementation.

Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The calculation 'byte(key%26+26) % 26' may lead to unexpected behavior if 'key' is not properly validated, potentially causing runtime panics or logic errors.
Solution: Validate 'key' to ensure it is within a specific range before performing operations. For example, ensure 'key' is a non-negative number less than 26.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input string which could contain non-alphabetic characters that are not intended to be encrypted, potentially exposing parts of the message in plaintext.
Solution: Add input validation to check for only alphabetic characters and either reject non-conforming inputs or handle them appropriately.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Encryption with Positive Key
Details:
  Description: Test the basic functionality of the `Encrypt` function with a positive rotation key. The test checks if the function correctly encrypts a simple lowercase alphabetic string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string input "hello" and a key of 3.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the prepared input and key.
  Assert: Verify that the output is "khoor" which is the expected encrypted string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if each character in the input string is shifted by three positions in the alphabet. This test is crucial to ensure that the basic encryption logic is implemented correctly and behaves as expected for simple cases.

### Scenario 2: Encryption with Negative Key
Details:
  Description: Verify that the `Encrypt` function correctly handles a negative rotation key, effectively rotating the characters in the opposite direction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the input string "hello" and a key of -3.
  Act: Execute the `Encrypt` function using these parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is "ebiil".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly interpret and process negative keys, which is important for scenarios where decryption is needed or keys might be dynamically provided in negative values.

### Scenario 3: Encryption with Key as Zero
Details:
  Description: Ensure that providing a key of zero results in no change to the input string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input string "hello" with a key of 0.
  Act: Run the `Encrypt` function.
  Assert: The output should be "hello".
Validation:
  Testing with a zero key checks that the function behaves as an identity operation where no shift is applied. This is a boundary condition test that ensures stability in edge cases.

### Scenario 4: Encryption with Special Characters
Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle strings containing non-alphabetic characters such as numbers and punctuation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input string "hello, world! 123" with a key of 2.
  Act: Call the `Encrypt` function.
  Assert: The output should be "jgnnq, yqtnf! 123".
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the encryption skips non-alphabetic characters, leaving them unchanged. It's important to ensure that the function can handle typical user inputs which may include various character types.

### Scenario 5: Encryption with Large Key
Details:
  Description: Test if the function correctly handles large keys by reducing them modulo 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input string "hello" and a key of 29 (which is effectively 3 modulo 26).
  Act: Execute the `Encrypt` function.
  Assert: The output should be "khoor".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly normalizes large keys to valid shifts, which is essential for handling arbitrary input values robustly.

### Scenario 6: Encryption of Empty String
Details:
  Description: Check the function's response when given an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string "" and any key, e.g., 5.
  Act: Run the `Encrypt` function.
  Assert: The output should be an empty string "".
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness when faced with minimal input, ensuring that it gracefully handles and returns empty outputs for empty inputs.

### Scenario 7: Encryption with Only Non-Alphabetic Characters
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly ignores all non-alphabetic characters and returns them as is.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input string "1234567890!@#$%^&*()" with a key of 3.
  Act: Invoke the `Encrypt` function.
  Assert: The output should be "1234567890!@#$%^&*()".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function does not alter numerical or special characters, maintaining data integrity for non-alphabetic content.
